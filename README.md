Poac (pronounced as `/pəʊək/`) is a package manager and build system for C++ users, inspired by Cargo for Rust.  Poac is designed as a structure-oriented build system, which means that as long as you follow Poac's designated project structure, you almost do not need configurations, much less a language to build, unlike CMake.  If you do not like writing a bunch of configurations to build your project, Poac might be best suited.  Currently, the supported project structure can be known by looking at this repository since Poac can build itself.
